### Data: Quantitative and Categorical data.
	- `Quantitative` data takes on numeric values that allow us to perform mathematical operations (like the number of dogs).
		- Continuous data can be split into smaller and smaller units, and still a smaller unit exists. An example of this is the age of the dog - we can measure the units of the age in years, months, days, hours, seconds, but there are still smaller units that could be associated with the age.

		- Discrete data only takes on countable values. The number of dogs we interact with is an example of a discrete data type.
		
	- `Categorical` are used to label a group or set of items (like dog breeds - Collies, Labs, Poodles, etc.).
	- We can divide categorical data further into two types: Ordinal and Nominal.

		- Categorical Ordinal data take on a ranked ordering (like a ranked interaction on a scale from Very Poor to Very Good with the dogs).

		- Categorical Nominal data do not have an order or ranking (like the breeds of the dog).

	- Analyzing Quantitative Data: Four Aspects for Quantitative Data.
		- There are four main aspects to analyzing Quantitative data.

		1. Measures of Center
		2. Measures of Spread
		3. The Shape of the data.
		4. Outliers
		
	- Measures of Center: There are three measures of center:
		1. Mean
		2. Median
		3. Mode
		
	- The Mean: The mean is often called the average or the expected value in mathematics. We calculate the mean by adding all of our values together, and dividing by the number of values in our dataset.
	
	- The Median: The median splits our data so that 50% of our values are lower and 50% are higher. 
	
	- The Mode: The mode is the most frequently observed value in our dataset.

	There might be multiple modes for a particular dataset, or no mode at all.

	No Mode
	If all observations in our dataset are observed with the same frequency, there is no mode. If we have the dataset:

	1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4

	There is no mode, because all observations occur the same number of times.

	Many Modes
	If two (or more) numbers share the maximum value, then there is more than one mode. If we have the dataset:

	1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 5, 6, 6, 6, 7, 8, 9

	There are two modes 3 and 6, because these values share the maximum frequencies at 3 times, while all other values only appear once.
	
	- Aggregations: An aggregation is a way to turn multiple numbers into fewer numbers (commonly one number).

		Summation is a common aggregation. The notation used to sum our values is a greek symbol called sigma.
