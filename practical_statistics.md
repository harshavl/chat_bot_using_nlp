
## Descriptive Statistics.

### Data: Quantitative and Categorical data.

`Quantitative` data takes on numeric values that allow us to perform mathematical operations (like the number of dogs).

**Continuous** data can be split into smaller and smaller units, and still a smaller unit exists. An example of this is the age of the dog - we can measure the units of the age in years, months, days, hours, seconds, but there are still smaller units that could be associated with the age.

**Discrete** data only takes on countable values. The number of dogs we interact with is an example of a discrete data type.
		
`Categorical` are used to label a group or set of items (like dog breeds Collies, Labs, Poodles, etc.).
We can divide categorical data further into two types: Ordinal and Nominal.

Categorical Ordinal data take on a ranked ordering (like a ranked interaction on a scale from Very Poor to Very Good with the dogs).

Categorical Nominal data do not have an order or ranking (like the breeds of the dog).

Analyzing Quantitative Data: Four Aspects for Quantitative Data.
There are four main aspects to analyzing Quantitative data.

	1. Measures of Center
	2. Measures of Spread
	3. The Shape of the data
	4. Outliers

Measures of Center: There are three measures of center:
	1. Mean
	2. Median
	3. Mode
		
The **Mean**: The mean is often called the average or the expected value in mathematics. We calculate the mean by adding all of our values together, and dividing by the number of values in our dataset.

The **Median**: The median splits our data so that 50% of our values are lower and 50% are higher. 

The **Mode**: The mode is the most frequently observed value in our dataset.

There might be multiple modes for a particular dataset, or no mode at all.

**No Mode**
If all observations in our dataset are observed with the same frequency, there is no mode. If we have the dataset:

1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4

There is no mode, because all observations occur the same number of times.

**Many Modes**
If two (or more) numbers share the maximum value, then there is more than one mode. If we have the dataset:

1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 5, 6, 6, 6, 7, 8, 9

There are two modes 3 and 6, because these values share the maximum frequencies at 3 times, while all other values only appear once.

**Aggregations**: An aggregation is a way to turn multiple numbers into fewer numbers (commonly one number).

Summation is a common aggregation. The notation used to sum our values is a greek symbol called sigma.

**Measures of Spread** are used to provide us an idea of how spread out our data are from one another. Common measures of spread include:

	Range
	Interquartile Range (IQR)
	Standard Deviation
	Variance
	

**Histograms** are super useful to understanding the different aspects of quantitative data. 
	center
	spread
	shape
	outliers

**Calculating the 5 Number Summary**
The five number summary consist of 5 values:

Minimum: The smallest number in the dataset.
â€‹	
Q1: The value such that 25% of the data fall below.
	
Q2: The value such that 50% of the data fall below.

Q3: The value such that 75% of the data fall below.

Maximum: The largest value in the dataset.

**Range** is then calculated as the difference between the maximum and the minimum.

**IQR** The interquartile range is calculated as the difference between Q3 and Q1.

**Descriptive vs. Inferential Statistics**
`Descriptive` statistics is about describing our collected data using the measures: measures of center, measures of spread, shape of our distribution, and outliers. We can also use plots of our data to gain a better understanding.

`Inferential` Statistics is about using our collected data to draw conclusions to a larger population. Performing inferential statistics well requires that we take a sample that accurately represents our population of interest.

A common way to collect data is via a survey. However, surveys may be extremely biased depending on the types of questions that are asked, and the way the questions are asked.

	Population: our entire group of interest.
	Parameter: numeric summary about a population
	Sample: subset of the population
	Statistic: numeric summary about a sample
